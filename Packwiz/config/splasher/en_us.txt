surrender your defenses
lights ablaze
eyes wide open
a world now bursting with sound
darkness deepens nearby
do you sense its weight?
can you feel its pull?
home rediscovered in every familiar corner
sleep in
let your dreams fade
turn away from the void as it gazes impassively
the heart's shadow retreats with purpose
unbind from the lofty grip of heaven
embrace the tang of bitter truth
sinking into a fervent chronology
decipher compassion with open eyes
as smooth as velvet over your soul
inhale the rebirth as night softens the day
another revelation beyond the veil
principle upon principle unveiled
falsehoods have never been so near
falsehoods have never drifted so far
stealthily, the cosmos fails to notice me
only now do i grasp connection
in chaos, meaning annuls
in chaos, meaning is born anew 
included in a flawed utopia
denied the chance for a heaven of your own?
like mountains that steadfastly resist erosion
often, hearts unite as one
